## Introduction
When I was taking Introduction to Web Science at Old Dominion University, I had to do several projects which required the use of the twitter api. A lot of my assignments could not have been completed successfully without the use of the tweepy library in python. 

One of the problems I encountered was finding ways to manage my twitter api access tokens. Initially, this was done through the use of a json file, which did not work as well as I had hoped. I then looked into other formats to storing my access tokens and discovered the config parser library in python.
